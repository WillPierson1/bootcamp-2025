        <!-- About Me -->

        <h2 id="aboutme">About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm Will. A <em>22 year old</em> telecommunications engineer, working to support small to medium size businesses with their <strong>VoIP Telephony needs</strong>. Having been in the industry for nearly 5 years, I've worked my way up to Senior Technical Engineer and begun to teach the skills I've learnt to some of our new hires.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my free time, I'm a snowboarder at heart! I like to spend my winters at indoor snow centres in prep for my yearly snowboarding holiday. The last few years I've been in France to test out my skills! This year I'm hoping to spend some time in the Austrian alps.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm also learning German, which I began learning at the start of this year. I've recently come back from a holiday in Munich where I got to test out my skills. You could say I'm an expert in ordering coffee!
